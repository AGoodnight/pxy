pxy

By specifying a target DOM element, the tool will report the pointers location (x and y) relative to the origin of the DOM element. The report will appear as an appended div with a position of absolute. I used this in a project recently. It requires jQuery, so itâ€™s useful for jQuery builds.

var myPxy = pxy(myDiv)

now you will get the pointers x and y in raltion to myDiv.
